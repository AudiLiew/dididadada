## When to Pack Your Hospital Bag

From 2016 to 2018, the majority of mothers gave birth at around 38<sup>th</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> week. So with that in mind, it is a good idea to pack your bag around the 36<sup>th</sup> week.

## Essential Items to Pack

As I would be doing the administrative work, I packed the documents together with the items I needed for the stay. 

My wife's bag consisted of her items and our baby's.

I will touch on what to bring for daddy later, for now let us go over the essential items for mommy and child.

### Mommy and Baby's Bag

#### Outfits for Discharge

During your stay at the hospital, you will be provided with sets of hospital gown. When it is time for discharge, you can finally don your own clothes. But don't go aiming for your cropped top or body-hugging dresses.

Wear loose comfortable clothes. Choose an outfit with a possibility of needing a c-section in mind.

#### Maternity/breast pads

Breast milk is <a href="https://www.healthxchange.sg/women/post-pregnancy/breastfeeding-health-benefits-baby" target="_blank">highly nutritious</a> for 

 - disposable panties
 - swaddling blanket
 - personal comfort
 - binder (c-sect)
 
 - Wet wipes
 - Extras:
   - hair ties
   - slippers
   - Personal breast pump, teach you
   - Extension Cords
   - Newborn car seat
   - Your cell phone charger likely won't reach the outlets on the wall from the bed so having that cord is incredibly handy (especially after a c section!)

Pro-tip ‚úåüèª: Mummy-to-be, once you have prepared the items, have your significant other pack the items with you. So when you need something, he/she will know where it is in the bag.{class="post-bignote"}

### Daddy's Bag

#### Hospital Admission Documents

Your gynae will pass you a set of documents around the 37<sup>th</sup> week. Ours included notes regarding my wife's pregnancy, and heartbeat print-outs of our baby from the <abbr title="Electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>. Don't worry too much about what is inside, just bring the envelope provided by your gynae.

#### NRICs / Identification Cards

During the admission process, you will need to provide the NRICs of both parents. To make it easier to find, I placed both NRICs together with the following...

#### Hospital Card (if you have one)

We had signed up for Thomson Medical's membership and were provided with their card. This allowed us to enjoy some discounts on their services.

#### Camera

If Daddy is joining in the delivery suite or operating theatre---which I highly recommend, be sure to bring along a camera or at least your phone to capture the first few moments of your baby. These photographs are going to be priceless. 

#### Change of Clothes

For natural deliveries, the typical stay is for two nights, whereas for caesarean section, it is three. Bring enough clothes for those days plus a set of PJs.

And lastly,

#### Credit Card

I know this seems obvious, but in times of panic, it is easy to forget this. Note: The hospital will require a deposit during admission.

If you would like to improve the quality or comfort level during the stay, you can bring along the following:

#### Pair of Slippers
