With the approaching due date, it is highly recommended to pre-pack the items to take with you to the hospital.

This will eliminate any last minute panic and ensure that you have the item you need.

In this post, I'll list out the things to bring along to the hospital for the big day.

## When to Pack Your Hospital Bag

The majority of Singaporean mothers gave birth at around 38<sup>th</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> week. So with that in mind, it is a good idea to pack your bag around the 36<sup>th</sup> week.

## Items to Pack

As I would be doing the administrative work, I packed the documents together with the items I needed for the stay. 

Whereas my wife's bag consisted of her items and our baby's.

I will touch on what I brought later, for now let us go over the items for mommy and child.

### Mommy and Baby's Bag üë©üèªüë∂üèª

First the essentials:

#### Outfit for Discharge

During your stay at the hospital, you will be provided with sets of hospital gown. When it is time for discharge, you can finally don your own clothes. But don't go reaching for your cropped top or body-hugging dresses.

Wear loose comfortable clothes instead. Choose an outfit with a possibility of needing a c-section in mind. 

#### Maternity/breast pads

Breast milk is not only {% extlink 'highly nutritious for your baby', 'https://www.healthxchange.sg/women/post-pregnancy/breastfeeding-health-benefits-baby' %}, the early initiation and regular expression of breast milk is also {% extlink 'beneficial to mothers', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29876577' %}. 

Once you begin breast feeding, leakage can happen. 

This is where the pads come in. They work like sponges to soak up any involuntary discharge.

Side note: Our gynae recommended us to get fenugreek as a supplement to boost milk production, so you might want to try it.

#### Disposable Panties

After delivery it is a good idea to be wearing disposable panties to prevent staining your favourite pair of undergarment. 

Go for the "granny" designs as they are often loose-fitting and have more coverage.

#### Baby's Outfit

We purchased some new clothes around two to three months before my wife's EDD as we wanted to welcome our little one into the house in a cutesy dress.

We brought along two sets of clothes of differing sizes as the estimated weight from the scans are just that, they are estimates. 

And luckily we did as our daughter came out around 500 grams heavier üòÜ

Also bring a swaddling blanket if you have one.

But if you forgotten the outfit or swaddle, fret not, as the hospital will provide a set for your little one.

If you had opted for a c-section, bring along the following items too:{.post-break}

#### Wet Wipes

You will be lying on your bed for the first two to three nights post delivery to minimise any aggravation to your wound---remember, c-sect *is* a major surgery.

This means that you will not be able to bath during this period. *\*Yeah, I know*\*

It is unlikely that you will develop any bed sores, but not bathing can make you feel yucky and uncomfortable. So wiping down with some wipes can make you feel that much cleaner. 

#### Binder

In an effort to regain their pre-pregnancy figure, some mothers have used abdominal binders to wrap up their tummies. Using it as a corset.

But that is actually **not** the purpose of a binder. Like our gynae put it, *"The binder not for slimming ah."*

Abdominal binders can help to {% extlink 'reduce any postoperative pain', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962320/' %} you may be having. It also compresses and provides support to your hip area. 

Remember to align the incision line to the middle of the binder. It should resemble a micro-skirt.

Some additional items you can consider bringing too are:{.post-break}

 - **Hair Ties**
 - **Slippers/Flip-flops**
 - **Personal Breast Pump**: So you can get the nurses to teach you how to use it

Pro-tip ‚úåüèª: Mummy-to-be, once you have prepared the items, have your significant other pack the items with you. So when you need something, he will know where it is in the bag.{class="post-bignote"}

### Daddy's Bag üë®üèª

#### Hospital Admission Documents

Your gynae will pass you a set of documents around the 37<sup>th</sup> week. Ours included notes regarding my wife's pregnancy, and heartbeat print-outs of our baby from the <abbr title="Electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>. Don't worry too much about what is inside, just bring along the envelope provided by your gynae.

#### NRICs / Identification Cards

During the admission process, you will need to provide the NRICs of both parents. To make it easier to find, you can placed both NRICs together with the following...

#### Hospital Card (if you have one)

We had signed up for Thomson Medical's membership and were provided with their card. This allowed us to enjoy some discounts on their services.

#### Camera

If Daddy is joining in the delivery suite or operating theatre---which I highly recommend, be sure to bring along a camera or at least your phone to capture the first few moments of your baby. These photographs are going to be priceless. 

#### Change of Clothes

For natural deliveries, the typical stay is for two nights, whereas for caesarean section, it is three. Bring enough clothes for those days plus a set of PJs.

Pack in long pants if you are not used to sleeping in an air-conditioned room.

#### Handphone Charger

You will be busy updating your family and friends with the latest photos of your little one and the status of your wife. And probably also sneaking in some Netflix time in between. So juice it up.

#### Credit Card

I know this seems obvious, but in times of panic, it is easy to forget this. Note: The hospital will require a deposit during admission.

#### Newborn Car Seat

Ok, this got me some wide eyes when they knew I was bringing a car seat.

Firstly, know that it is {% extlink 'mandatory in Singapore', 'https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/RTA1961-S688-2011#pr8-' %} to secure your child (below 1.35m in height) in a car seat. This includes any {% extlink 'private hire cars', 'https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2017/2/3/private-hire-cars-not-exempt-from-child-seat-requirement.html' %}. Only taxis and buses are exempted.

More importantly though, a car seat can {% extlink 'protect your little one', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2529436/' %} in an event of an accident.

If you would like to improve the quality and comfort level during your stay, you can also bring along the following:{.post-break}

 - **Pair of Slippers**: Perfect footwear to air your feet;
 - **Eye Mask**: This is for people who needs to sleep in pitch dark rooms, as the nurses will be entering the room through out the night to check on your wife;
 - **Bedsheet**: The companion will be sleeping on a sofa. Not comfy warm beds. And the sofa can feel too cold to the skin in an air-conditioned room.
