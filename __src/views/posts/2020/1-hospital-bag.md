## When to Pack Your Hospital Bag

From 2016 to 2018, the majority of mothers gave birth at around 38<sup>th</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> week. So with that in mind, it is a good idea to pack your bag around the 36<sup>th</sup> week.

## Essential Items to Pack

As I would be doing the administrative work, I packed the documents together with the items I needed for the stay. 

My wife's bag consisted of her items and our baby's.

### Daddy's List

#### Hospital Admission Documents

Your gynae will pass you a set of documents around the 37<sup>th</sup> week. Ours included notes regarding my wife's pregnancy, and heartbeat print-outs of our baby from the <abbr title="Electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>. Don't worry too much about what is inside, just bring the envelope provided by your gynae.

#### NRICs / Identification Cards

During the admission process, you will need to provide the NRICs of both parents. To make it easier to find, I'd placed both NRICs together with the following...

#### Hospital Card (if you have one)

We had signed up for Thomson Medical's membership and were provided with their card. This allowed us to enjoy some discounts on their services.

#### Camera

If Daddy is joining in the delivery suite or operating theatre---which I highly recommend, be sure to bring along a camera or at least your phone to capture the first few moments of your baby. These photographs are going to be priceless. 

#### Change of Clothes

#### Pair of Slippers

### Outfits for Discharge (Mom, Dad, and Newborn)
 - pack your going home outfit with the possibility of needing a c-section in mind. I packed pants that sat right on my incision and I was in agony on the way home.
   - loose comfortable clothes
   - swaddling blanket
 - Maternity/breast pads
 - personal comfort
 - disposable panties
 - binder (c-sect)
 - For Mummy
 - For Newborn
 
 - Wet wipes
 - Extras:
   - hair ties

Pro-tip ‚úåüèª: Mummy-to-be, once you have prepared the items, have your significant other pack the items with you. So when you need something, he/she will know where it is in the bag.{class="post-bignote"}
