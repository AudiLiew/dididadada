## When to Pack Your Hospital Bag


From 2016 to 2018, the majority of mothers gave birth at around 38<sup>th</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> week. So it is a good idea to pack your bag around the 36<sup>th</sup> week.

Pro-tip ‚úåüèª: Mummy-to-be, once you have prepared the items, have your significant other pack the items with you. So when you need something, he/she will know where it is in the bag.{class="post-bignote"}
