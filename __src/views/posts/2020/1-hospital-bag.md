Outline:
 - Intro
   - Final step before newborn joins your family...
   - first-time parents nervous wrecks
 - When to Pack Your Hospital Bag
   - 35th week
   - have your SO, or whoever might be in the room with you, pack the bag once you've chosen the items. This way when you need something, they'll know exactly where it is in the bag
 - Before you pack
   - Check the latest gifts from the hospital you'll be delivering in
     - 
 - Essentials
   - Hospital documents
   - NRICs
   - Hospital membership card (if you have one)
   - outfits for discharge, mommy and newborn
     - pack your going home outfit with the possibility of needing a c-section in mind. I packed pants that sat right on my incision and I was in agony on the way home.
     - loose comfortable clothes
     - swaddling blanket
   - Maternity/breast pads
   - personal comfort
   - Camera
   - disposable panties
   - binder (c-sect)
   - For Mummy
   - For Newborn
   - For Daddy
     - Eye mask
     - Ear plugs
     - long pants
     - pillow/sheet
     - cash/credit card
     - some form of entertainment
   - Wet wipes
   - Extras:
     - hair ties
     - slippers
     - Personal breast pump, teach you
     - Extension Cords
     - Newborn car seat
     - Your cell phone charger likely won't reach the outlets on the wall from the bed so having that cord is incredibly handy (especially after a c section!)
 - Pro-tips
   - Do not overpack, make going back home a chore
   - Send some gifts/items back home before discharge
