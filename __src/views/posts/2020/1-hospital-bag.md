## When to Pack Your Hospital Bag

From 2016 to 2018, the majority of mothers gave birth at around 38<sup>th</sup> to 39<sup>th</sup> week. So with that in mind, it is a good idea to pack your bag around the 36<sup>th</sup> week.

## Items to Pack

As I would be doing the administrative work, I packed the documents together with the items I needed for the stay. 

My wife's bag consisted of her items and our baby's.

I will touch on what to bring for daddy later, for now let us go over the essential items for mommy and child.

### Mommy and Baby's Bag

First the essentials:

#### Outfits for Discharge

During your stay at the hospital, you will be provided with sets of hospital gown. When it is time for discharge, you can finally don your own clothes. But don't go reaching for your cropped top or body-hugging dresses.

Wear loose comfortable clothes instead. Choose an outfit with a possibility of needing a c-section in mind. 

#### Maternity/breast pads

Breast milk is not only {% extlink 'highly nutritious for your baby', 'https://www.healthxchange.sg/women/post-pregnancy/breastfeeding-health-benefits-baby' %}, the early initiation and regular expression of breast milk is also {% extlink 'beneficial to mothers', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29876577' %}. The nurses at the hospital will likely encourage you to breast feed your child.

Once you begin breast feeding, leakage can happen. 

This is where the pads come in. They work like sponges to soak up any involuntary discharge.

Side note: Our gynae recommended us to get fenugreek as a supplement to boost milk production.

#### Disposable Panties

After delivery it is a good idea to be wearing disposable panties to prevent staining your favourite pair of undergarment. 

Go for the "granny" designs as they are often loose-fitting and have more coverage.

<br>And if you have opted for a c-section, bring along the following items too:

#### Wet Wipes

You will be lying on your bed for the first two to three nights post delivery to minimise any aggravation to your wound---remember, c-sect *is* a major surgery.

This means that you will not be able to bath during this period. *\*Yeah, I know*\*

It is unlikely that you will develop any bed sores, but not bathing can feel yucky and uncomfortable.

So wiping down with some wipes can make you feel that much cleaner. 

#### Binder

In an effort to regain their pre-pregnancy figure, some mothers have used abdominal binders to wrap up their tummies. Using it as a corset.

But that is actually **not** the purpose of a binder. As our gynae put it, *"The binder not for slimming ah."*

Abdominal binders can help to {% extlink 'reduce any postoperative pain', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962320/' %} you may be having. It also compresses and provides support to your hip area. 

Remember to align the incision line to the middle of the binder. It should resemble a micro-skirt.

 - swaddling blanket
 
 - Extras:
   - hair ties
   - slippers
   - Personal breast pump, teach you
   - Extension Cords
   - Newborn car seat
   - Your cell phone charger likely won't reach the outlets on the wall from the bed so having that cord is incredibly handy (especially after a c section!)

Pro-tip ‚úåüèª: Mummy-to-be, once you have prepared the items, have your significant other pack the items with you. So when you need something, he/she will know where it is in the bag.{class="post-bignote"}

### Daddy's Bag

#### Hospital Admission Documents

Your gynae will pass you a set of documents around the 37<sup>th</sup> week. Ours included notes regarding my wife's pregnancy, and heartbeat print-outs of our baby from the <abbr title="Electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>. Don't worry too much about what is inside, just bring the envelope provided by your gynae.

#### NRICs / Identification Cards

During the admission process, you will need to provide the NRICs of both parents. To make it easier to find, I placed both NRICs together with the following...

#### Hospital Card (if you have one)

We had signed up for Thomson Medical's membership and were provided with their card. This allowed us to enjoy some discounts on their services.

#### Camera

If Daddy is joining in the delivery suite or operating theatre---which I highly recommend, be sure to bring along a camera or at least your phone to capture the first few moments of your baby. These photographs are going to be priceless. 

#### Change of Clothes

For natural deliveries, the typical stay is for two nights, whereas for caesarean section, it is three. Bring enough clothes for those days plus a set of PJs.

And lastly,

#### Credit Card

I know this seems obvious, but in times of panic, it is easy to forget this. Note: The hospital will require a deposit during admission.

If you would like to improve the quality or comfort level during the stay, you can bring along the following:

#### Pair of Slippers
