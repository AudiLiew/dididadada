## What is Baby Bonus?

Baby Bonus is a financial aid provided by the Singapore Government to offset some of the cost of child-rearing. 

It was <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/2000082001.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first introduced</a> in 2000's National Day Rally, in an attempt to improve the declining birth rate in Singapore, and has since been <a href="https://www.strategygroup.gov.sg/images/chart7.png.pdf#page=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressively enhanced</a> in 2004, 2008, and 2013. 

The Baby Bonus scheme consists of two components: a) **Cash Gift** -- yup, cold, hard cash ðŸ’µðŸ’°, and b) Co-savings in the **Child Development Account** (CDA).

I will touch on the CDA in a bit, but let's dig into the cash portion first shall we?

### Baby Bonus: Cash Gift

For your first child, you will receive S$8,000 in total. This amount is not paid out in one go, but split into five payments.

## What is a CDA?

The Child Development Account (CDA) can only be used in your child's educational and healthcare expenses.

You **cannot** withdraw the amount in your child's CDA as cash.

is meant to support the developmental needs of children, such as education and healthcare. Parents can use the CDA to pay for expenses at Approved Institutions such as child care centres, kindergartens, hospitals clinics and pharmacies.
