Before I touch on what baby bonus is, congrats on having your first child!

Right, so you heard about this incentive the Singapore Government is offering but not quite sure what it is all about.

In this article, I will walk you through what Baby Bonus is and how it can help you.

Let's go:

## What is Baby Bonus?

{# https://www.todayonline.com/business/prepare-cost-raising-child-0 #}

Baby Bonus is a financial aid provided by the Singapore Government to offset some of the cost of child-rearing. 

It was <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/2000082001.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first introduced</a> in 2000's National Day Rally, in an attempt to improve the declining birth rate in Singapore, and has since been <a href="https://www.strategygroup.gov.sg/images/chart7.png.pdf#page=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressively enhanced</a> in 2004, 2008, and 2013. 

The Baby Bonus scheme consists of 2 components: 

  1. **Cash Gift** --- yup! cold, hard cash üíµüí∞; and 
  2. Co-savings in the **Child Development Account** (CDA).

I will touch on the CDA in a bit, but let's dig into the cash portion first shall we?

## Baby Bonus: Cash Gift

For your first child, you will receive $8,000 in total. 

This amount is --- unfortunately? --- not paid out in one go. 

It is split into five payments:

Milestones | Payment
---|:---:
7 to 10 working days after registering your child's birth <sup><a href="#note-child-birth">[1]</a></sup> | $3,000
Child turns 6 months old | $1,500
Child turns 12 months old | $1,500
Child turns 15 months old | $1,000
Child turns 18 months old | $1,000

<ol class="post-notes">
  <li id="note-child-birth">
  
  There are three ways to register your child's birth. You can either register at the hospital your child is delivered; do a walk-in <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/citizen/birth/citizen_birth_register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration at <abbr title="Immigration & Checkpoints Authority">ICA</abbr></a>; or through the *Moments of Life* app. 

  *Moments of Life* app store links: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.app.mol&hl=en_SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/moments-of-life/id1383218758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>.
  
  </li>
</ol>

### How to Receive the Baby Bonus Cash Gift?

To receive the cash gift, you'll need to provide the bank account details when you join the baby bonus scheme. 

You can either use the *Moments of Life* app mentioned earlier, or you can fill up this <a href="https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg/parent/web/enrolment-instruction?_afrLoop=18416975738619105&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D18416975738619105%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D6duztwbsm_13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online form</a>.

Pro-tip ‚úåüèª: Use the *Moments of Life* app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.app.mol&hl=en_SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/moments-of-life/id1383218758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>) as you can register your child's birth and apply for the baby bonus scheme at the same time.{class="post-bignote"}

## Baby Bonus: CDA

The second component of baby bonus is the **Child Development Account** (CDA). 

It is a special savings account which you can use for your child's **educational** needs, such as child-care centres, kindergartens, special education schools; and **healthcare** expenses, such as hospitals/clinics and pharmacies. You can view the list of approved institutions over <a href="https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg/ai-home/xhtml/layout/ListOfAI.faces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

Note üìù: You **cannot** withdraw the amount in your child's CDA as cash.{class="post-bignote"}

Not to worry, as the balance amount will be transferred to a new <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/post-secondary/post-secondary-education-account/usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA)</a> when your child turns 13.

No money will be "eaten."

On the contrary, the Government will start off the account by putting in $3,000  --- called the *First Step Grant*. 

Additionally, the Government will match your contribution, dollar-for-dollar, up to $3,000. 

You can contribute anytime after the CDA has been opened and the amount will be matched within 2 weeks, eg. deposit $1,000 a week after the account is opened, and you will get the additional $1,000 within 2 weeks.

### How to Open a CDA?

There are three banks that you can choose from when you apply for the baby bonus scheme.

They are:

  1. <a href="https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/deposits/savings-accounts/child-development-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POSB</a>;
  2. <a href="https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/accounts/child-development-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCBC</a>; and
  3. <a href="https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings/child-development-account.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UOB</a>

When you apply for the scheme, there will be an option to choose your preferred bank.

This wraps up the guide to the baby bonus scheme. Once again, congrats! and happy parenting!
