## What is Baby Bonus?

Baby Bonus is a financial aid provided by the Singapore Government to offset some of the cost of child-rearing. 

It was <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/2000082001.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first introduced</a> in 2000's National Day Rally, in an attempt to improve the declining birth rate in Singapore, and has since been <a href="https://www.strategygroup.gov.sg/images/chart7.png.pdf#page=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressively enhanced</a> in 2004, 2008, and 2013. 

The Baby Bonus scheme consists of 2 components: 

  1. **Cash Gift** --- yup, cold, hard cash ðŸ’µðŸ’°; and 
  2. Co-savings in the **Child Development Account** (CDA).

I will touch on the CDA in a bit, but let's dig into the cash portion first shall we?

## Baby Bonus: Cash Gift

For your first child, you will receive $8,000 in total. 

This amount is --- unfortunately? --- not paid out in one go. 

It is split into five payments:

Milestones | Payment
---|:---:
7 to 10 working days after registering your child's birth <sup><a href="#cite-child-birth">[1]</a></sup> | $3,000
Child turns 6 months old | $1,500
Child turns 12 months old | $1,500
Child turns 15 months old | $1,000
Child turns 18 months old | $1,000

<ol class="notes">
  <li id="cite-child-birth">
  
  There are three ways to register your child's birth. You can either register at the hospital your child is delivered; do a walk-in <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/citizen/birth/citizen_birth_register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration at <abbr title="Immigration & Checkpoints Authority">ICA</abbr></a>; or through the *Moments of Life* app. 

  *Moments of Life* app store links: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.app.mol&hl=en_SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/moments-of-life/id1383218758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>.

  Methods two and three are more applicable to parents who have not decided on their child's name on delivery.

### How to Receive the Baby Bonus Cash Gift?

To receive the cash gift, you'll need to provide the bank account details when you <a href="https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg/parent/web/enrolment-instruction?_afrLoop=18416975738619105&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D18416975738619105%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D6duztwbsm_13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join the baby bonus scheme</a>. 

You can submit the form from two months before the estimated date of delivery.

## Baby Bonus: CDA

The second component of baby bonus is the **Child Development Account** (CDA). 

It is a special savings account which you can use for your child's **educational** needs, such as child-care centres, kindergartens, special education schools; and **healthcare** expenses, such as hospitals/clinics and pharmacies. You can view the list of approved institutions over <a href="https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg/ai-home/xhtml/layout/ListOfAI.faces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

Money from this account can be used until your child turns 13, by which the balance will be transferred to a new <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/post-secondary/post-secondary-education-account/usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA)</a>. 

### CDA First Step Grant

Note: You **cannot** withdraw the amount in your child's CDA as cash.
