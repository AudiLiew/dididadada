If <abbr title="Expected Due Date">EDDs</abbr> are anything to go by, I'll be a dad in roughly a month's time.

It feels surreal at the moment. It's finally going to happen. 

Seeing my wife's belly getting bigger by the week. Witnessing her struggles with her appetite in her first trimester, brought on by the undesirable metallic taste in her mouth and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/indigestion-heartburn-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indigestion</a>. 

Months of going to the gynae. Seeing our daughter slowly filling up and eventually outgrowing the black-and-white screen of the ultrasound scanner. The thumping lub-dubs from her heartbeat synchronising with the pulsing graph. Being able to tell which blob is her femur.

Being on pins and needles when getting the results from the smorgasbord of prenatel tests. 

The pain and sore my wife has to endure, including our daughter's <a href="https://www.matermothers.org.au/journey/pregnancy/your-baby-s-movements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jabs and kicks</a> and also the increasing weight of her developing fetus.

Days of laying my mouth on my wife's tummy, humming *twinkle little stars* and *do re mi*, and watching it bulge and jerk in response.

We'll finally be able to meet the tiny one responsible for all these soon.

I can't wait.
